## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

**Enabling AI agents to interact with Polkadot's Revive pallet smart contracts.**

This Revive Pallet Extension extends our successfully delivered Polkadot ElizaOS Plugin ([M1](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/1267), [M2](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/1271)) to enable AI agents to interact with smart contracts deployed on Polkadot's Revive pallet. This follow-up grant addresses the specific guidance provided by Web3 Foundation reviewers during our original grant process ([PR #2518](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/2518)), who recommended focusing on pallet-revive integration and direct chain interactions.

The plugin provides intelligent address routing between H160 and AccountId32 formats, dual-mode contract deployment and interaction, contract event monitoring, and basic analytics integration. It leverages both Revive's Ethereum RPC endpoints and native Substrate interfaces to provide AI agents with Revive interaction capabilities.

Our team successfully delivered the foundational Polkadot ElizaOS Plugin, demonstrating our capability in ElizaOS architecture and Polkadot integration. This project focuses solely on software integration and does not include any token issuance, financial instruments, or business-oriented services.

### Project Details

- **Data Models / API Specifications:**  
  Comprehensive API specifications covering:
  - Revive contract deployment via both upload_code and Ethereum RPC
  - Intelligent address routing (H160 ↔ AccountId32 conversion)
  - Unified contract interaction endpoints supporting both eth_call and bare_call
  - Revive-native asset management with ERC20 compatibility
  - Contract event querying and filtering via eth_getLogs
  - Subscan API integration for Revive contract analytics and verification status

- **Technology Stack:**  
  - **Core Integration:** TypeScript with polkadot-js API and Ethereum RPC client libraries
  - **Framework:** ElizaOS Plugin Architecture (extending our existing foundation)
  - **Revive Support:** Direct pallet-revive integration with dual-mode operation support
  - **Analytics:** Subscan API integration for Revive contract monitoring
  - **Testing:** Comprehensive unit and integration tests (>95% coverage) with Revive-specific validation

- **Architecture Innovation:**  
  Our dual-mode architecture allows a single action to automatically detect address types and route operations to the appropriate Revive execution layer (Substrate or Ethereum RPC), providing seamless interaction with Revive contracts regardless of the interface used for deployment.

- **Prior Work:**  
  Our team successfully delivered the foundational Polkadot ElizaOS Plugin, establishing wallet integration, on-chain data queries, governance interactions, and cross-parachain transfers. This follow-up builds directly on that proven foundation to add Revive pallet capabilities.

- **Scope Limitations:**  
  This project focuses exclusively on Revive pallet integration capabilities and does not include token issuance, DeFi protocol development, or business-oriented financial services.

### Ecosystem Fit

- **Target Audience:**  
  Developers building AI-integrated applications on Revive, smart contract developers seeking agentic automation, and researchers exploring autonomous blockchain interactions with Ethereum-compatible contracts on Polkadot.

- **Needs Addressed:**  
  It streamlines agentic access to Revive smart contracts, reducing the complexity of integrating Ethereum-compatible contract functionality into AI systems on Polkadot. The plugin addresses the need for intelligent address handling between H160 and AccountId32 formats and provides unified contract management regardless of deployment method.

- **Need Identification:**  
  During our original grant review ([PR #2518](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/2518)), Web3 Foundation reviewers specifically recommended focusing on pallet-revive integration and capabilities that go beyond data fetching to enable direct chain interactions. This proposal directly implements those recommendations.

- **Competitive Landscape:**  
  While basic smart contract integrations exist for other chains, no solution provides comprehensive agentic interaction with Polkadot's Revive pallet. Our plugin's focus on dual-mode operations (Ethereum RPC + Substrate) distinguishes it from existing solutions.

- **Related Projects:**  
  Similar integrations exist for Ethereum, but our solution is tailored specifically for Polkadot's Revive architecture and cross-chain interoperability features.

## Development Status :open_book:

We have conducted preliminary research into Revive pallet architecture and dual-mode contract interaction patterns, informed by Web3 Foundation reviewer feedback emphasizing pallet-revive integration.

Initial architectural designs for address routing between H160 and AccountId32 formats have been completed, and we have analyzed Revive's upload_code and eth_sendTransaction deployment methods. Our existing plugin architecture from the successfully delivered foundation ([M1](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/1267), [M2](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/1271)) provides the base for implementing Revive-specific capabilities.

## Future Plans

- **Long-Term Maintenance:**  
  We plan to sustain the project through continuous community contributions and by maintaining compatibility with evolving Revive pallet features. Our open-source approach ensures that the community can extend and improve the plugin over time.

- **Short-Term Enhancements:**  
  We will introduce additional parachain support as they adopt Revive, enhanced analytics capabilities, and improved error handling based on community feedback.

- **Ecosystem Expansion:**  
  As the Revive pallet evolves and more parachains implement it, we will expand support to ensure our plugin remains the comprehensive solution for agentic Revive interactions across the Polkadot ecosystem.
